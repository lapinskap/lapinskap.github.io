The application comes from PQ Studio workshops (programming labs) at Gorz√≥w University (AJP), which I attended with the permission of the dean's office. This is a different approach to React than the ones I have been learning so far. A good comparison of different conventions.

 It does not have its own webpack.config configuration - application made from scratch using create-react-app. Instead of SCSS preprocessor, app use styled-components. Another strange feature is Reactstrap. The application views are as follows:
