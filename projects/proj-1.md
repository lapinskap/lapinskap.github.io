title: 'Indecision App - ToDo in React'
---

My first steps to learn React Components. The playground folder contains simple jsx and es6 scripts, mainly the methods that I've learned to build more complex applications.
Inspired by Andrew Mead tutorials and React Documentation.
I implemented SCSS for the first time here + it is my first RWD experience (I added another styles for mobile devices)
