title: 'Expensify - React Router & Redux'
---

The application is not very inventive, for similar reasons as the Indecision-app, but I spent many hours with it learning how to build complex react applications. Thanks to this project I met the React Router and Redux.

<style> 
.btn {
    color: black;
    background-color: #e5e5e5;
    cursor: pointer;
    border: none;
}
</style>

In this example I got to know the concept of application testing and the first time I turned react app on the production mode.
